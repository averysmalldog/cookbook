## Notes

* I have never made this recipe with nuts. But I *have* made it with double the chocolate chips. The dough is pretty forgiving.
* This recipe is designed to require just two measuring tools: a 3/4 cup measure and a teaspoon. 3 scoops Flour, 1 scoop sugar, 1 scoop brown sugar, then 1 teaspoon each of soda, salt, and vanilla. And the rest is package-limited: 1 package chocolate chip package, 2 sticks of butter, 2 eggs. Pretty smart!
* I typically use a Silpat on the cookie sheet to make it a little simpler to remove the cookies. The only issue is that you'll be doing lots of batches, and the chocolate get smeared on the Silpat. So watch out for that!
