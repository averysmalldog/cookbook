# Banana Bread

A classic way to take those bananas you never ate and turn them into something *even more delicious*.

## Tools

* Loaf Pan
* Mixing Bowl
* Mixing Spoon
* Oven, preheated to 350° F

## Ingredients

* 3-4 **Bananas**, overripe
* 1/3 cup **Butter** (softened)
* 1 cup **Sugar**
* 1 **Egg** (beaten)
* 1 teaspoon **Vanilla**
* 1 teaspoon **Baking Soda**
* pinch **Salt**
* 1 1/2 (1.5) cups **Flour**

## Instructions

1. Mix **butter** and **bananas** in the mixing bowl.
2. Add in **sugar**, the beaten **egg**, and **vanilla** and mix.
3. Sprinkle in **baking soda** and **salt**, and mix.
4. Mix in **flour**.
5. Pour into loaf pan and bake for 1 hour at 350° F.
6. Cool for about 5-10 minutes before serving.

## Notes

* I usually butter and flour the loaf pan to make removing the bread easier.
* I have made this recipe with bananas that were _black_. Like, they looked dead. Still came out great.
