# Chicken Tetrazzini

A classic midwestern-style casserole.

## Tools

* Large Sauce Pan (for Spaghetti)
* Pasta Spoon (for Spaghetti)
* Frying Pan `OR` Crock Pot (for Chicken)
* 9" x 12" Casserole Dish
* Chef's Knife
* Large Mixing Bowl
* Oven, preheat to 350° F

## Ingredients

* 1x 12 oz. package of **Spaghetti** (cooked and drained)
* 3 tablespoons **Margarine**
* 1x medium **Onion** (chopped)
* 1/2 cup **Bell Pepper** (chopped)
* 3 cups **Chicken** (cooked and diced)
* 2 cups **Monterrey Jack Cheese** (grated)
* 1 can **Cream of Mushroom Soup**
* 1 can **Cream of Celery Soup**
* 1/2 cup **Milk**
* **Salt and Pepper** "to taste"

## Instructions

1. Prep all the ingredients that have prep rules in parentheses `(...)`:
    1. Cook and drain the **spaghetti**.
    2. Cook and dice the **chicken**. The original recipe doesn't specify *how*, I usually just pan fry it up to temp.
    3. Chop the **onion** and **bell pepper**.
    4. Grate the **cheese** if you didn't buy it pre-grated.
2. Take the **onion** and then sautée it in the **margarine**. Get it translucent.
3. Mix the **onion** and remaining ingredients with cooked **spaghetti** in a large mixing bowl.
4. Prep the casserole in either one large pan or two smaller pans. Either cook now or freeze for another day.
5. Bake the thawed casserole 30-40 minutes at 350° F.

## Notes

* Makes 6 sizable servings.
* Modern packages of spaghetti are actually 16 oz., so if you prep a whole package, you're going to have an *abundance* of spaghetti for this dish. Not the end of the world.
* Margarine has largely fallen out of favor. Butter works just fine instead.
* If you can't get one of the soups, double up on the other.
