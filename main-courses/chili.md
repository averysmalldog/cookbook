# "Jane's" Chili

This is a recipe I got at some point in Austin. It's a really straightforward chili recipe and it usually is well-received.

## Tools

* 2x Skillets/Frying Pans
* 1x Large Sauce Pan `OR` Crock Pot
* Spatulas
* Cutting Board
* Chef's knife
* Stove

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs. **Ground Beef** (80-85% lean)
* 1 can **Black Beans**
* 0.5 bag **Frozen Corn**
* 1 **Onion** (chopped and sautéed)
* 2 **Tomatoes** (chopped)
* 1 **Bell Pepper** (chopped)
* 1x 26 oz. can **Tomato Sauce**
* "some" **Mild Chili Seasoning** (1 packet is usually enough, but sometimes you want more)

## Instructions

1. Chop and sautée the **onion**. Basically, get it translucent.
2. Brown the **beef** and drain the fat.
4. Chop your **tomatoes** and **bell pepper**.
3. Combine all ingredients in the sauce pot `OR` the crock pot.

If you choose to use a crock pot, let it go on low for quite a while. Otherwise, simmer in the sauce pan for maybe 20-30 minutes.

## Notes

* This recipe *still works* without the bell peppers and with the tomatoes puréed instead of chopped!
* The chili tastes the same or better as leftovers.
* If you make too much, you won't be sorry.
