Split Pea Soup

I am cooking, which is always a health risk (for anyone who might eat what I cook). But I have a recipe for a split pea soup that I created last night which actually was pretty tasty.

1. Send your long-suffering non-quarantined wife to the store at off-peak hours and have her buy bags of dried split peas, beans, and rice. Onions, bacon, and sausage, tabasco sauce, salt and pepper.
2. Store the beans and rice for some other day, or use them to weight down your drive wheels if it gets too icy on the road.
3. Put the split peas in a big pot with a lot of water and boil them for one hour. 1 lb of peas, about 6 quarts of water (that is 1.5 gallons, or 0.036 bbls depending on how you measure stuff). Make sure to cover the peas, people. Turn off the heat after an hour. Let them sit.
4. Go off and do something else for about 24 hours. Me, I've scheduled a contractor to build some steps in the back yard.
5. Come back the next day about an hour before dinner time and put some bacon in a frying pan. I used five (not six, not three, not four unless you are then continuing to five) strips of bacon. That filled my pan. Turn on the heat. As the bacon begins to sizzle, cut up two large onions (yes, you have to peel off the outer skin and cut them into little itty bitty bits - do I have to tell you everything?).
6. Start to re-heat the peas. Keep the heat low and stir often, you don't want to burn them. Burnt peas are bad, trust me on this, and very hard to clean.
7. Dump the ontions over the bacon, mix 'em up and stir for a while. Add olive oil if your wife bought the "fat free" kind of bacon that doesn't have a lot of fat.
8. Cut up four sausages and add that to the bacon and onions which is now threatening to ignite on the cooktop. Stir until the onions are caramelized (see, that is a real word that a professional cook would use).
8a. Extract the bacon (with a fork) and cut it into little pieces. I forgot to mention this step, so it is now step 8a instead of 9. Good luck. The bacon will be really hot.
8b. Ok, yes, put the hot bacon bits back in with the flaming onions as you forgot to turn off the heat while you were cutting up the bacon. Try to figure out where the dang fire extinguisher is, or keep baking soda near to hand.
9. Dump the onion mess into the peas which should now be bubbling in the big pot. Recite Shakespeare, "boil, boil toil and trouble, fire burn and cauldron bubble" (loosely adapted for this recipe). Note that the bubbling thing will tend to kill off most of the bacteria that were feasting on your peas during the previous 24 hours.
10. Find the salt you had your wife buy earlier. We like that Himalayan Sea Salt, mostly because it is geologic in nature, but also because it has a very salty taste. I would cup my left had, as I am right handed, and pour a small mountain into that cupped hand, then throw all of that into the peas. If you want to get technical, try 2 tbs, or (for those Europeans out there) 28.3 grams. The 0.3 grams are really important, as you can tell by my careful cupped hand measurement. If that's not enough, put in some more.
11. Grind up some pepper if you can find it in the house as you had forgotten to ask your wife to buy more in the empty shelves of your local 365 Whole Foods store. If you can't find much pepper, well, too bad.
12. Grasp the bottle of Tabasco Sauce. Address it in a firm manner, "do not spill upon my hands, or into mine eyes, thy shaper of calls to poison control, as I have Dawn dishwashing liquid and can dispense with your evil burn if necessary".
13. Pour a lot of the Tabasco sauce into the bubbling peas. If any bacteria had been left alive they will now die a horrible death, screaming in agony, without the ability to dial 911, as bacteria cannot dial a rotary phone.
14. Reconsider the Tabasco sauce and pour some more in. This will be (most likely) the only thing you taste for the next several weeks.
15. Let the mixture boil for 20 minutes. If your wife is hungry you can let her have a bowl after about 10 minutes. If she survives then you can serve yourself a bowl.

That is my recipe. Bon Appetite.

Have Fun,
Chip
